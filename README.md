## Installing


Ensure you are using async-lru installed from the master branch on its [github](https://github.com/aio-libs), not from PyPI. Install these type stubs from git:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/aio-libs/async-lru
```

This library does not include async-lru as a dependency. You must install it yourself.
